# Security Guidelines

## Mandatory Security Checks

Before ANY commit:
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- [ ] All user inputs validated
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS prevention (sanitized HTML)
- [ ] CSRF protection enabled
- [ ] Authentication/authorization verified
- [ ] Rate limiting on all endpoints
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive data

## Secret Management

- NEVER hardcode secrets in source code
- ALWAYS use environment variables or a secret manager
- Validate that required secrets are present at startup
- Rotate any secrets that may have been exposed

## Security Response Protocol

If security issue found:
1. STOP immediately
2. Use **security-reviewer** agent
3. Fix CRITICAL issues before continuing
4. Rotate any exposed secrets
5. Review entire codebase for similar issues

## Owen's Domain Context (Auto-appended)
- Language: Python stdlib-only CLI tools, no web/Docker/ML/databases
- Domain: CMake/C/C++ firmware open-source compliance (SBOM, GPL/LGPL checkpoints)
- Testing: pytest (no existing suites — TDD adoption is the highest-value addition)
- Compliance artifacts require careful review before commit
- Analyze C/C++ firmware but write Python only
